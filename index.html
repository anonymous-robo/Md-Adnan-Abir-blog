            <h2 id="intro">Introduction:</h2>
            <p class="pera">According to "Patients Action Network", Ms. Bunnie from Texas said that,</p>
            <blockquote>“I'm 78 years old. Telemedicine is so much more convenient then trying to get a ride. I can keep appointments when I feel too bad to go to the doctor.”</blockquote>
            <p class="pera">That is how with the help of digital technologies, medical care is becoming more convenient and accessible daily. Regular hospital visits might get expensive, especially for people living in remote areas who have to waste a good amount of money and time to get better treatment. On top of that, after the Covid-19 pandemic breaks out, physical interaction has become riskier. In this situation, telemedicine can be a savior for both patients and healthcare providers. On the one hand, with the blessing of virtual technologies, one can get super-fast health care at their preferable time, and on the other hand, it can reduce the precious time and cost of the treatment.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="what">What is telemedicine:</h2>
            <p class="pera">The prefix 'Tele' comes from the Greek, which means 'at a distance'; hence telemedicine means medicine or medical service at a distance. It refers to the use of electronic communication technologies such as video conferencing, live chat, audio assistance, and messaging to provide healthcare services remotely, including online patient consultations, telehealth nursing, remote physical and psychiatry rehabilitation, etc. It has the potential to improve access to healthcare for underserved and remote populations and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery.<br>But, as communication technologies are upgrading every second, it's hard to describe it in some words. The sector of internet consultation is getting bigger rapidly. Rather than just giving consultancy, distance operating is also involved with the help of machine learning, robotics, and, most notably, AI technologies.</p>
